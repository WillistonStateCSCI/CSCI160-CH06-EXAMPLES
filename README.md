Programming Examples From Java Illuminated Book by Anderson and Franceschi  
**Example06_01** - This program prompts the user for integers and outputs them to console until a sentinel value is entered.  
**Example06_02** - This program demonstrates how to read input from a text file.  
**Example06_03** - This program adds the entered numbers until a sentinel value is entered.  
**Example06_04** - This program takes test scores as input until a sentinel value is entered, and then outputs the passing scores.  
**Example06_05** - This program takes test scores as input until a sentinel value is entered, and then outputs the average of the scores.  
**Example06_06** - This program takes input from grades.txt and then outputs the maximum test grade.  
**Example06_07** - This program demonstrates how to read an integer given by the user and use it in output.  
**Example06_08** - This program shows how to ensure your user is entering the correct data type.  
**Example06_09** - This program is our first example of a compound loop function, using a menu to order food.  
**Example06_10** - This program uses a *while* loop to ensure the user has entered a number between 1 and 10.  
**Example06_12** - This program finds the total of five numbers using a *for* loop.  
**Example06_13** - This program uses a *for* loop to print the even numbers from 0 to 20.  
**Example06_14** - This program counts the number of tokens (non-white space characters delimited by one or more white spaces) in a sentence.  
**Example06_15** - This program demonstrates how to print a sentence backwards.  
**Example06_17** - This program demonstrates how to print numbers in a triangle using nested *for* loops.  
**Example06_18** - This program uses a *do/while* loop to factor integers and check for primes.
